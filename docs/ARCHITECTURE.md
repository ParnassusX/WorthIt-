# WorthIt! Bot Architecture

## System Overview
WorthIt! is a Telegram bot that helps users evaluate product value through automated analysis of product listings, reviews, and market data. The system uses advanced AI/ML techniques to provide comprehensive product analysis and value assessment.

## Core Components

### 1. Telegram Bot (bot/)
- **Purpose**: User interface and interaction handling
- **Key Files**:
  - `bot.py`: Core bot logic and command handlers
  - `webhook_handler.py`: Webhook endpoint for Telegram updates
- **Features**:
  - Custom keyboard interface
  - URL detection and validation
  - Inline buttons for actions
  - Web app integration for scanning
  - Markdown formatting support

### 2. API Service (api/)
- **Purpose**: Product analysis and data processing
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/analyze`: Product analysis endpoint
  - `/health`: Service health check
  - `/monitoring`: System metrics
- **Components**:
  - URL validation and security checks
  - Product data extraction
  - Review analysis
  - Value scoring calculation

### 3. Web App (web-app/)
- **Purpose**: Rich interface for detailed analysis
- **Components**:
  - `index.html`: Main interface
  - `app.js`: Frontend logic
  - `styles.css`: UI styling
- **Features**:
  - Camera integration for scanning
  - Real-time analysis feedback
  - Responsive design

## Data Flow
1. User sends product URL to bot or uses web scanner
2. Bot validates input and forwards request to API
3. API performs:
   - URL validation and security checks
   - Product data extraction (Apify)
   - Review analysis (HuggingFace)
   - Price comparison
   - Value scoring
4. Results formatted with emojis and markdown
5. Interactive response with action buttons

## Integration Points

### External Services
- **Apify**: Web scraping
  - Used for: Product details extraction
  - Integration: `api/scraper.py`
  - Status: Configuration ready

- **HuggingFace**: AI/ML processing
  - Used for: Sentiment analysis, feature extraction
  - Integration: `api/ml_processor.py`
  - Status: Initial implementation

- **Supabase**: Data storage
  - Used for: User preferences, analysis history
  - Integration: `api/db.py`
  - Status: Schema defined

## Security Considerations
1. Environment variables for all sensitive data
2. Rate limiting on API endpoints
3. Input validation for all user data
4. Secure webhook endpoints
5. URL validation against allowed domains
